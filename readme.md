# Implementation of different iterative methods to solve poisson's equation

Each of the 5 methods are implemented in one script called "IterativeSolvers":
1. Point Jacobi
2. Gauss-Seidel
3. Successive over-relaxation
4. Conjugate gradient
5. Multigrid

There is a variable called "method" that needs to be changed when looking at the different iterative methods. The possible methods are: "PJ", "GS", "SOR", "CG", or "MG".
